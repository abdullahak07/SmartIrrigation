 # Smart Irrigation System
 ## Who doesn't love having some greenery in their home? Plants are low maintenance and can survive for days without supervision. However, when we go on long trips for a week or two, our plants may suffer due to lack of moisture in the soil, leading to withering or even death. To address this issue, we have developed an Automatic Irrigation System using an Arduino Uno that can keep your plants healthy even when you are away for extended periods. The system uses a Moisture sensor to maintain the optimal level of moisture for your plants, making it suitable for both outdoor gardens and indoor plants. With this system, you can take care of your leafy companions even when you're not around.
